# Tableau-Regional-Sales-Analysis

In this project, we'll delve into the world of sales performance analysis by developing an informative and interactive dashboard with Tableau. The goal is to compare sales data from two specific regions, allowing the organization to make data-driven decisions for improvement. By visually analyzing key metrics such as total sales, average sales per order, customer count, number of orders, and product performance, this project will provide a strategic advantage to recognize growth possibilities and areas for improvement.

## Project Objective
Create a dynamic and interactive Tableau dashboard to compare sales performance between two selected regions, offering insights into:

 --> Total Sales
 
 --> Average Sales per Order
 
 --> Number of Customers
 
 --> Number of Orders
 
 --> Number of Products in Sale

## Project Scenario
Sales performance analysis is critical to strategic planning. As a data analyst, your job is to evaluate and interpret sales data from two regions, giving higher management a clear picture of performance variances. This analysis will be used to make data-driven decisions, plan strategically, and identify areas for improvement. Your dashboard will enable the team to assess how each location performs across a variety of criteria, making it an effective tool for improving sales strategies.

## Task Breakdown

   1. Sales Performance Parameters
      
      Create Parameters: To make region selection easier, create parameters for both the Primary and Secondary Regions.
      
      Calculated Fields: Filter and compare data based on the regions you've selected.
      
      Sales Visualization: Display total sales for both regions in separate worksheets for easy comparison.
      
   3. Average Sales and Order Statistics
      
      Average Sales Per Order: Create a worksheet to calculate and compare average sales per order in both regions.
      
      Total number of orders: Count and display the number of orders for each region.
      
      Filters: Use region filters to ensure that the data displayed is relevant to the specified regions.

   5. Customer and Product Analysis.
      
      Customer Count: Make a worksheet to keep track of the number of unique customers in each region.
      
      Products Sold: Create a worksheet that displays the number of distinct products sold by region.
      
      Filters: Apply region-specific filters to ensure accurate data analysis.
      
   7. Comparative Analysis.
      
      Create a dashboard: Organize all of the worksheets into a single, cohesive dashboard.
      
      Partitioning the dashboard: Use containers to neatly separate the dashboard into sections, one for each region.
      
      Interactive Controls: Include parameter controls that allow users to dynamically select different regions, updating the visualizations real time.

## Expected Results:
The final Tableau dashboard will provide a dynamic, real-time view of sales performance in the two selected regions. Management will be able to interact and compare:

   --> Total sales and average sales per order.
   
   --> Number of Customers
   
   --> Number of Orders
   
   --> Number of products sold
   
With this information, the organization will be able to make strategic decisions, identify areas for improvement, and fine-tune their sales strategies for increased performance.

## Conclusion
This project allows you to create a highly interactive dashboard that communicates critical information about sales performance. By comparing two regions, you can help the organization identify opportunities, streamline strategies, and improve overall performance. The skills and techniques you'll learn in this project—from data preparation and parameter creation to dashboard design—will be invaluable to any data analyst looking to make a significant impact in sales and business analytics.
